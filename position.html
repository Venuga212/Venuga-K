        <p class="para1"> Oxygen is a non-metal element that is a gas at room temperature. Its molecules contain two oxygen atoms. Oxygen is vital for respiration, which is the process that transfers energy from glucose to cells. Oxygen is necessary for burning to occur.
            Common uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving. Oxygen gas is found mainly in the atmosphere, which contains approximately 21% oxygen by volume, along with 78% nitrogen and small amounts of other gases. Some oxygen is also found dissolved in water. Polltion is the introduction of containements that cause adverse change. Environmentalism is more popular than ever—and with good reason: never has our dependency on the natural world or our culpability in its ongoing destruction been clearer. I’ll spare you the customary roll call of ecological crises that tends to open articles about the environment (for every person spurred into action, another is sunk into despondency), but suffice it to say that our planet is in serious trouble. </p>   
            <p class="para2"> If humanity is to survive this century with any semblance of the quality of life enjoyed today, all of us need to act quickly to limit and reverse anthropogenic climate change and environmental destruction.It’s therefore heartening to see enthusiasm for environmentalism on the rise. Across much of Europe, support for Green parties is increasing. In the United States, three-quarters of people think more should be done to end the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. The 2019 climate strike was one of the largest protests ever staged with an estimated six million people around the world—from Antarctica to Zambia—protesting leaders’ continued inaction over the destruction of the planet. By itself, however, environmentalism doesn’t necessarily translate into effective action. An appreciation of the natural world and a concern for its future can inspire us to act, but it can’t tell us how to act. How do we develop renewable sources of energy? How do we best preserve remaining areas of wilderness? And how do we build sustainable agricultural systems capable of feeding a global population rapidly hurtling toward ten billion? To answer these vital questions, we need science. </p> </div>
